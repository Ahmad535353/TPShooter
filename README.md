## **Introduction**
Welcome to **TPShooter**, a first-person shooter developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5. Delving deep into the realm of C++ programming, blueprints have been utilized only where essential, striking a balance between efficiency and flexibility.

This README sheds light on the technical prowess, the tools used from Unreal Engine 5, and the advanced C++ techniques employed.

## **Technical Highlights**

### **C++ Programming**:

- **Custom AI Logic**: Leverage UE5's AI toolset combined with custom C++ logic, making adversaries challenging and lifelike.
  
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Ensured smooth performance with dynamic memory allocations, data structures, and custom class management.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Embraced OOP principles for modular and maintainable code, encompassing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  
- **Advanced Game Mechanics**: Mastered C++ to implement intricate gameplay mechanics, such as bullet physics, dynamic health systems, and inventory management.

- **Multi-Threading**: Utilized multi-threading to boost performance, ensuring game processes run concurrently and efficiently.

### **Unreal Engine 5 Features**:

- **Environment & Level Design**: Designed captivating and interactive environments utilizing UE5's landscape tools and Quixel Megascans for photorealistic assets.

- **AI Pathfinding & Behavior**: Implemented dynamic AI systems, ensuring enemies utilize the environment strategically, challenge players, and adapt to player strategies.

- **Lumen Global Illumination**: Exploited Lumen's capabilities for real-time dynamic global illumination, resulting in photorealistic settings.
  
- **World Partition System**: Employed the world partitioning system for dynamic game world streaming, ensuring performance peaks based on player location.

- **Chaos Physics & Destruction**: Infused dynamic environment destruction for an immersive combat experience.

### **Blueprint Integration**:

- **Character Animation**: Merged Blueprints with character animations, creating fluid and organic movement systems.
  
- **UI/UX Design**: Meshed UE5's UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) with Blueprints for user-friendly HUDs, menus, and GUIs.

- **Event Systems**: Harnessed Blueprint events for game progression, triggers, and world interactivity.
